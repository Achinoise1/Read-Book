\subsection{总结}
\subsection{不足与展望}




In this project design, we need to design a \emph{SafeHome System} appling the \textbf{Scenario-Based Modeling}. Using which if you want to understand how users want to interact with a system\cite{roger2015software}. In all, the whole project can be devided into four parts:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Determine actors and the corresponding functions
    \item For each function write story to extract actions
    \item Write formal (Structured) use-cases
    \item Create swimlane diagram for each use-case
\end{enumerate}

\section{Actors and Functions}

\subsection{Actors}

Actors are those individuals or systems that will interact with the application\cite{Lance2018Creating}. When defining the actors, one may just think of the perspective from the \emph{C-S} structure, that is, client(Homeowner) and server(Administrator). But there are several other actors that interact with the system from not just a software perspective, but also from an external software and hardware perspective. In addition, these actors should be broken down into two categories, primary and secondary. The primary actor is the actor that is directly interacting with the system to achieve a goal. The secondary actor is the actor is external to the system, but is called upon to help complete a goal. So here are my design for Safehome actors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary Actor:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Administrator
              \item Homeowner
          \end{itemize}

    \item Secondary Actor:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Camera
              \item Sensor
          \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functions}
After we determined the Actors, we need to consider what functions does these actors need to perform. And from those actions, we can derive Use-Cases. So here are my design for Safehome functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Administrator:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item Register new Homeowner
              \item Delete Homeowner
              \item Add/Remove Camera
              \item Add/Remove Sensor
              \item Contact Homeowner/Emergency service when Emergency
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Homeowner:
          \begin{itemize}
              \item Information Security Related:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \setcounter{enumi}{5}
                        \item Login (Validate user ID and password)
                        \item Logout
                        \item Modify profile
                    \end{enumerate}
              \item House Safety Related:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \setcounter{enumi}{8}
                        \item View Cameras
                        \item Zoom selected Camera
                        \item Show thumbnails of all Cameras
                        \item Record and Replay Camera video
                        \item Activate/Deactivate Cameras
                        \item Activate/Deactivate Sensors
                        \item View history records
                    \end{enumerate}
          \end{itemize}

    \item Camera:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \setcounter{enumi}{15}
              \item Activate/Deactivate
              \item Zoom in/out
              \item Record Video
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Sensor:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \setcounter{enumi}{18}
              \item Activate/Deactivate
              \item Gather data
              \item Send data to Homeowner/Administrator
          \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\section{User Scenario}

The scenario approach is a high level description with the key components listed out in a stepwise manner\cite{Lance2018Creating}. To better illustrate the Use-Cases of the actors, we need to come up with a narrative scenario for each Use-Case, a lateral description, without side interactions. After that, all we need to do is conduct a step-by-step analysis of the scenario to extract the actions.


% Login to the system
\subsection{Scenario 1: Login to the system}

\textbf{Scenario story:}

If I want to check the status of my house, I need to login to the system. I may choose to login using my PC or my mobile phone with the application or a browser to the \emph{SafeHome Products} website. After I input my user ID and password, the system will validate my user ID and password. If the user ID and password are correct, I will be able to login to the system. If the user ID and password are incorrect, I will be prompted to re-enter my user ID and password. And once I login to the system, I will be able to view the status of my house and will have access to all functionality my installed \emph{SafeHome} system.

\textbf{Actions:}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The homeowner logs onto the \emph{SafeHome Products} website on his PC or opens the \emph{SafeHome} application on his mobile phone.
